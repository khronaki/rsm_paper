AQ3:
We would like to separate these Figures and use for Figure 2a the number Figure 2 and Figure 2b becomes Figure 3.
Then update also the next Figures of the document accordingly.

Other remarks:
1. The references 1 and 21 are the same. Could you remove the reference number 21 of them and use the other instead?

2. The refereces 22, 25 and 26 should use short conference mames.
These should appear as: 
reference 22:

3. In the abstract add the word "multicore" before "systems" in the last sentence:
"From our evaluation using 11 parallel workloads on both symmetric and asymmetric multicore systems,
we obtain performance improvements up to 15×, averaging to 3.1× over the baseline."

4. Add the following reference in the related work at the end of the sentence "These designs require the implementation of a hardware component for each core of an SoC[REF]":

Architectural Support for Task Dependence Management with Flexible Software Scheduling. In: HPCA, pp. 283-295 (2018)

5. In the entire document: replace multi-core/Multi-core with multicore/Multicore 

6. In some places throughout the document Section is written as Sect.. Please modify it throughout the entire document so that it is cosistently referred as "Section"

7. We would like to respect the page limit of 20 pages. As I see the proof is 21 pages long, while our original camera-ready document was 19 pages long. Maybe the font size has changed?

8. Please allow some space between the introduction text and the Springer Copyright.

9. Figure 1 should be on the top of the previous page of where Listing 1.4 is. So in the proof, it should be on page 6.

10. Listing 1.5 should be on page 8 according to the proof. (one page earlier)

11. Figure 2 (both figures side by side) should be one page earlier (page 9 of the proof)

12. Table 1 should be one page earlier (page 10 of the proof)

13. Figure 3 should be one page earlier (page 12 of the proof)

14. Figure 4 should be at the top of the next page of Figure 3

15. Figure 6 should be at the top of the page (the next page after Figure 5)

16. Please balance the emails so that there are three emails on the first row and two emails on the second row.
