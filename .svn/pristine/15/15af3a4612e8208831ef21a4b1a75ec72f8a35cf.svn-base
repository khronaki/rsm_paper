As described in the previous section, {\proposal} assumes the existence of a specialized hardware that accelerates the task creation step. The SRT is bound to this task creation accelerator and executes the requests in the RRQ. Previous works have proposed custom accelerators for the runtime activity~\cite{TaskSS, Xubin, Nexus, Swarm, TMU, Carbon}. These proposals significantly accelerate (up to three orders of magnitude) different bottlenecks of the runtime system\footnote{Section~\ref{sec:related} further describes these proposals.}. These special purpose designs can only execute runtime system activity.

As an alternative, in our envisioned architecture we propose to have a general purpose core that has been optimized to run the runtime system activity more efficiently. 
The runtime optimized (RTopt) core can be combined with both homogeneous or heterogeneous systems and accelerate the runtime activity.
Figure~\ref{fig:hw} shows the envisioned architecture when RTopt is combined with an asymmetric heterogeneous system.
%Figure~\ref{fig:hw} shows the envisioned asymmetric multi-core architecture with different core types. 
This architecture has three core types that consist of simple in-order cores, fast out-of-order cores and an RTopt core for the SRT. 
RTopt can optimize its architecture for this specific SRT, having a different cache hierarchy and pipeline configuration. 
As a result, the RTopt executes the SRT much faster than the other cores. 
The RTopt can also execute tasks, but will achieve limited performance compared to the other cores as its hardware structures have been optimized for a specific software (the SRT).

To evaluate our approach we study the requirements of the RTopt in order to provide enough performance for {\proposal}.
Based on the analysis by Etsion et al.~\cite{TaskSS}, there is a certain \textit{task decode rate} that leads to optimal utilization of the multi-core system.
This rule can be applied in the case of {\proposal} for the \textit{task creation rate}, i.e. the frequency of task generation of the runtime system.
If the \textit{task creation rate} is higher than the \textit{task execution rate}, then for a highly parallel application the resources will always have tasks to execute and they will not remain idle.
To achieve a high \textit{task creation rate}, we can accelerate the task creation cost.
Equation~\ref{eq.create} shows the maximum optimal task creation cost, $C_{opt}(x)$ in order to keep $x$ cores busy, without starving due to task creation.

\begin{equation}
  \text{$C_{opt}(x) = avg.\ task\ duration / x$ }

If $C_{gp}$ is the cost of task creation when it is performed on a general purpose core, then the RTopt has to achieve a speedup of $r = C_{gp}/C_{opt}(x)$ to achieve full utilization of the system. As we will see in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}, a modest and implementable value of $r=16\times$ is enough to significantly accelerate execution in a 512-core system.

Finally, if {\proposal} executes on a regular processor without the RTopt core, the SRT is bound to a regular core without any further modification. In this scenario, applications will not significantly benefit from having a separate SRT.
