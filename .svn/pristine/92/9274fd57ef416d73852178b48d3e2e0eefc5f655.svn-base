There has been a lot of studies on AMC systems. Some works focus on the design of the system, while other works explore the challenges that appear in efficiently utilizing such a heterogeneous system.
Kumar et al~\cite{Kumar_micro_2003} present the idea of an AMC system and proposed a feedback-based way to dynamically migrate processes among the different cores.
