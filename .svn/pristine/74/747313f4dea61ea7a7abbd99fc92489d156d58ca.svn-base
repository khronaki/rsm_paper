\subsection{Simulator}
To evaluate our runtime system we make use of the TaskSim simulator~\cite{AbstrLevels_TACO12}. 
TaskSim allows the specification of a homogeneous or heterogeneous systems with many cores. 
We can configure the amount of cores of each type and the difference in performance between the different types (performance ratio) in the TaskSim configuration file.
In our experiments, 

we evaluate the effectiveness of CATS on a total of 80 distinct heterogeneous machine configurations. These comprise systems with the total number of cores ranging from 16 to 128, and the number of fast cores ranging from 1 to 16. For all these configurations, we evaluate the following performance ratios between fast and slow cores: 2$\times$, 2.5$\times$, 3$\times$, 3.5$\times$ and 4$\times$.
