\kc{TODO: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Write intro
\end{itemize}
Proposed names instead of RAM (runtime activity manager):
\begin{itemize}
\item CreTA Creation of Tasks Accelerated
\item RTGen: Rapid Task Generation 
\item TaskGenX: Task Generation eXpress
\item GenX or xGen: Express (task) generation
\item QTP: Quick Task Production
\end{itemize}
I think I prefer the RTGen but maybe the TaskGenX sounds better and people will remember it...

Task creation is the main bottleneck on parallel applications.
In this paper we present how a specialized HW can overcome this issue by executing explicitly task creation.
This design gives us high performance improvements for systems of up to 512 cores.
