\kc{TODO: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Add justification for 16x faster task creation
\item Modify the comparison section in order to group the other approaches
\item Modify the hetero figures adding the BASELINE+HW bar
\item Mention that performance ratio is 4 because of the avg measured perf ratio
\item Explain dedup performance
\item Review Background and our work and simplify task creation
\end{itemize}
Proposed names instead of RAM (runtime activity manager):
\begin{itemize}
\item RTGen: Rapid Task Generation 
\item TaskGenX: Task Generation eXpress
\item GenX or xGen: Express (task) generation
\item QTP: Quick Task Production
\end{itemize}
I think I prefer the RTGen but maybe the TaskGenX sounds better and people will remember it...

Task creation is the main bottleneck on parallel applications.
In this paper we present how a specialized HW can overcome this issue by executing explicitly task creation.
This design gives us high performance improvements for systems of up to 512 cores.
