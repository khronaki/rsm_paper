Many works in the research community focus on hardware support to boost performance of runtime systems.
Carbon~\cite{Carbon} accelerates the scheduling of tasks by implementing hardware ready queues.
Picos++~\cite{Xubin} is a hardware-software co-design that supports nested tasks. 
This design enables the acceleration of the inter-task dependencies on a special hardware.
Nexus\#~\cite{Nexus} is a distributed hardware accelerator capable of executing the \textit{in}, \textit{out}, \textit{inout}, \textit{taskwait} and \textit{taskwait on} pragmas.
This design requires the implementation of one hardware component for each core of an SoC.

All these works focus on the hardware design. 
Our proposal is a runtime system capable of supporting any  specialized hardware to accelerate parts of the runtime.
Moreover we find that accelerating task creation has the most efficient outcome.
